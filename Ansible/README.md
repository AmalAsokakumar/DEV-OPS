Ansible is an open-source software automation tool that can be used to configure and manage servers, network devices, and other IT infrastructure. It allows users to automate repetitive tasks, such as installing software, configuring services, and managing users, using simple, human-readable code.

Ansible is often used as a configuration management tool, which means it can be used to manage the configuration of servers and other IT infrastructure in a consistent and predictable manner. This can help to reduce errors and improve the overall reliability of infrastructure deployments.

Ansible is also often used as an IT automation tool, which means it can be used to automate various IT tasks, such as provisioning servers, deploying software, and managing users. This can help to save time and improve the efficiency of IT operations.

Ansible uses a simple, human-readable language called YAML to define automation tasks, which can be organized into playbooks. Playbooks are a collection of tasks that can be run together to accomplish a specific automation goal, such as provisioning a new server or deploying a new application.

Ansible also includes a built-in command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the Ansible engine and perform various tasks, such as running playbooks, managing users, and viewing the status of automation tasks.

Ansible is also extensible, which means it can be integrated with other tools and services, such as Terraform and Jenkins, to create a complete end-to-end infrastructure management workflow. This allows users to automate the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure as part of a continuous integration and delivery pipeline.

In summary, Ansible is a powerful open-source automation tool that can be used to configure and manage servers, network devices, and other IT infrastructure. It is widely used as a configuration management and IT automation tool, and it can be integrated with other tools and services to create a complete end-to-end infrastructure management workflow.


Ansible is an open-source automation tool that can help with configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses a simple, human-readable language called YAML to describe automation tasks, and communicates with managed hosts over SSH.

Ansible is used to automate a wide range of tasks, including:

Installing and configuring software on servers
Managing and updating server configurations
Deploying applications and code
Managing system and user accounts
Running scripts and arbitrary commands on managed hosts
Ansible is designed to be simple to use, with a minimal learning curve. It does not require any agents or additional software to be installed on managed hosts, and it can be run from any machine that has Python installed.

Ansible is typically used in IT environments to automate repetitive tasks, improve consistency and reliability, and reduce the time and effort required to manage servers. It can also be used in other areas such as IoT, Network and Cloud infrastructure.

Ansible uses a concept called "playbooks" to define automation tasks. Playbooks are written in YAML and are composed of one or more "plays," which specify the tasks to be performed on managed hosts. Each play maps a group of hosts to a set of tasks, which are defined using Ansible's built-in modules.

Ansible also offers a feature called "Ansible Galaxy" which is a central hub for sharing and discovering Ansible content. It allows users to find, download and use pre-made roles, which are collections of tasks, files, and variables that can be easily reused and shared across projects.

Ansible's flexibility and ease of use make it a popular choice among system administrators and DevOps engineers. It is also supported by a large and active community, which contributes to its ongoing development and provides a wealth of resources and documentation.
