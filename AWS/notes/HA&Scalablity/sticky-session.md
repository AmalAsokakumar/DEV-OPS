 Sticky sessions, also known as session affinity, is a feature of load balancers that allows them to route requests from the same client to the same server. This is useful when a client needs to maintain a session with a specific server, such as when the client is authenticated and the server needs to maintain the client's session state.

When a client makes a request to a load balancer, the load balancer uses a session identifier (such as a cookie) to determine which server the client's previous request was sent to. If the client has a session with a specific server, the load balancer will route subsequent requests from the same client to the same server. This ensures that the client's session state is maintained and that the client continues to interact with the same server.

Sticky sessions are typically used in conjunction with other load balancing techniques, such as round-robin or least connections, to ensure that traffic is distributed evenly across servers while also maintaining client sessions.

It's important to note that sticky sessions can be a double-edged sword. On one hand it ensures that the client interacts with the same server, so the session information is maintained, but it can also lead to uneven load distribution and a single server can be overwhelmed with a heavy load of requests from a specific client, leading to poor performance.



When using sticky sessions with cookie-based session affinity, the load balancer uses a cookie to identify the server that a client's previous request was sent to. The cookie's name and duration are typically configurable options that can be set according to the specific requirements of the application.

A commonly used cookie name is JSESSIONID which is the default cookie name used by Java-based web applications. Some other common names include ASP.NET_SessionId, PHPSESSID, and ROUTEID.

The duration of the cookie is also configurable, it can be set to a specific amount of time, or it can be set as a "session cookie" that expires when the user closes their browser.

When the cookie is set to expire after a specific amount of time, it's important to make sure that this time is long enough to cover the duration of a typical user session, but not so long that it may become stale or insecure.

On the other hand, when the cookie is set as a "session cookie" it's important to keep in mind that if the user closes the browser, the session will be lost and the client will be sent to a different server. This can be useful when you want to avoid having a large number of users with stale sessions, but it can also lead to a loss of session data and a poor user experience.

It's important to note that when the cookie name and duration are changed, it's necessary to update the application code and configuration accordingly, to ensure the application will set the cookie with the correct name and duration. Also, it's important to keep in mind that the cookie name should be unique and not used by other applications or services running in the same domain, to avoid conflicts.
