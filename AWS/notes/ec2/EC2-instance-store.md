# An EC2 instance store

An `EC2 instance store,` also known as `ephemeral storage`, is a type of `non-persistent` storage that is physically attached to the host computer of an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. It is typically used for `temporary data` that changes frequently, such as operating system `swap `space, log files, and temporary files.

Instance store is different from Elastic Block Store (EBS) in that the data stored on an instance store is `not` automatically `backed up` and is `lost `if the instance is `terminated or stopped`. However, the data stored on an instance store can be `accessed faster` than data stored on an EBS volume, as it is stored on the host computer's local storage.

We use instance stores in scenarios where data that is stored on the instance needs to be accessed at high speeds, for example, when using a compute optimized instances for `high-performance computing` (HPC), or when using instances that require `low latency`. Additionally, ephemeral storage can be used when the data stored on the instance is `not critical`, and can be `re-created` easily.

Instance stores are used in various scenarios such as:

`High-performance computing `(HPC) workloads where `low latency` and `high` `IOPS `are required

Applications that require large amounts of temporary storage, such as `video encoding` or `data processing`

`Stateless applications`, where data can be re-created easily in case of instance failure

`Big data processing`, where high-performance storage is critical to the performance of the application.

It's worth noting that `not all instance` `types` `support instance stores`, and the amount of instance store storage available may vary depending on the instance type

Instance stores are also commonly used as a temporary storage for data that is generated by an application and needs to be quickly accessed by that application. This can include things like application logs, temporary files, and cached data. Because the data stored on an instance store is not persisted after the instance is terminated, it is not typically used for storing critical data that needs to be retained. Instead, it is used as a high-performance storage option for data that can be easily regenerated in case of failure.

Another benefit of instance stores is that they are `physically attached to the host computer`, which means that the data stored on them can be accessed at much `higher speeds` than data stored on a `network-attached storage device`. This makes instance stores well-suited for workloads that require high IOPS and low latency.

Additionally, some instances types have multiple instance stores and can be striped across multiple instance stores for increased performance.

In summary, instance stores are a type of non-persistent storage that is physically attached to the host computer of an EC2 instance. They are typically used for temporary data that changes frequently and can be accessed at high speeds. They are suitable for high-performance computing workloads, applications that require large amounts of temporary storage, stateless applications, and big data processing. Not all instance types support instance stores, and the amount of instance store storage available may vary depending on the instance type.
