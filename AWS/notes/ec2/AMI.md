# An Amazon Machine Image

    An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured virtual machine image, provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), that can be used to launch an instance (a virtual server) in the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). An AMI contains all the information necessary to launch a fully-functional instance, including the operating system, applications, and any additional software.

An AMI can be created from a variety of sources, including:

An existing EC2 instance
A Virtualization environment (e.g. VMware, VirtualBox)

- An EBS snapshot
    Once an AMI has been created, it can be used to launch new instances in any availability zone in the AWS region where the AMI is stored. This allows users to quickly spin up new instances that are pre-configured with the same software and settings as previous instances. This can save time and effort when creating new instances, as the software and configurations do not need to be set up from scratch.

    Additionally, AMIs can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public, allowing other users to launch instances from the same image. This can be useful for sharing common configurations or for distributing software.

    In summary, AWS AMI is a pre-configured virtual machine image that can be used to quickly launch new instances with the same software and settings, this can save time and effort when creating new instances. AMIs can be created from a variety of sources and can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public.
