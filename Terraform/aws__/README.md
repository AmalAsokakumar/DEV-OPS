# In Terraform, there are several types of modules that can be used to organize and reuse Terraform code:

1. `Root modules`: These are the `top-level` modules in a Terraform configuration, and define the overall structure of the infrastructure.
2. `Child modules`: These are modules that are `called by` other modules, and can be used to `encapsulate` specific infrastructure components or resources.
3. `Provider modules`: These are modules that provide a specific provider for Terraform, such as AWS or Azure, and can be used to manage resources within those providers.
4. `Terraform registry modules`: These are modules that are publicly available on the Terraform Registry, and can be easily imported and used in Terraform configurations.
5. `Custom modules`: These are modules that are created by the user and are specific to the organization, they can be used as a way to organize and reuse the code.
